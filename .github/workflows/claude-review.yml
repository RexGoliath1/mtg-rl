            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }}

            Review this pull request for the ForgeRL project (RL for Magic: The Gathering).

            Workflow:
            1. Run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }}` to read the diff
            2. Analyze the changes for bugs, security issues, and consistency
            3. Post your review using `gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }}` with your findings
            4. Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` for line-specific feedback

            Do NOT explore the broader codebase or run tests. Focus on the diff.

            Conventions: UV + pyproject.toml, python3 not python, ruff (E501 ignored).

            Format: ❌ blockers, 💡 suggestions, ✅ approvals. Keep it concise.
            Only post GitHub comments — don't submit review text as messages.

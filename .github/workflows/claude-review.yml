            Review this PR for the ForgeRL project (RL for Magic: The Gathering).

            IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on the PR diff. Do NOT explore the full codebase.
            Read the changed files, review the diff, and post your review promptly.
            You have limited turns — prioritize posting the review over deep exploration.

            Check for:
            1. Bugs or logic errors in the changed code
            2. Security issues (secrets, injection)
            3. Missing test coverage for new logic
            4. VOCAB_SIZE / MAX_PARAMS sync issues (must match across vocabulary.py, precompute_embeddings.py, game_state_encoder.py)

            Conventions: UV + pyproject.toml, python3 not python, ruff with E501 ignored, cloud-first (no local runs > 50 games).

            Use: ❌ blockers, 💡 suggestions, ✅ approvals. Keep review concise.
